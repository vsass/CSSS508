## <span style="color:blue">{{< fa hand-finger-up >}}</span> Facet scales options
By default, facets will share the same axis ranges (i.e. "fixed") which is helpful for comparison across groups. However, sometimes you may want to visualize the relationship within each facet better. You can set the `scales` argument to "free", "free_y" or "free_x" to allow scales to vary by both `x` and `y` axes, or just one.
