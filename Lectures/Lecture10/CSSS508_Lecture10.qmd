# Code Style

## Naming Variables 

It's good practice to name variables using only lowercase letters, numbers, and `_` (to separate words). 

. . . 

Remember to give them descriptive names, even if that means they're longer. 

. . . 

If you have many related variables, try and be consistent with your naming convention. 
* A common prefix is preferable to a common suffix due to RStudio's autocomplete feature. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Code goal: 
short_flights <- flights |> 
  filter(air_time < 60)

# Code foul: 
SHORTFLIGHTS <- flights |> 
  filter(air_time < 60)
```

## Spacing 

For readability you'll want to put spaces around all mathematical operators^[except for ^] (i.e. `+`, `-`, `==`, `<`, etc.) as well as the assignment operator (`<-`). 

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Code goals: 
z <- (a + b)^2 / d
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)

# Code foul: 
z<-( a + b ) ^ 2/d
mean (x ,na.rm=TRUE)
```

. . . 

To make code easier to skim quickly it's alright to add extra space for better alignment. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
flights |> 
  mutate(
    speed      = distance / air_time,
    dep_hour   = dep_time %/% 100,
    dep_minute = dep_time %%  100
  )
```
