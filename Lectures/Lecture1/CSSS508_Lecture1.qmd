## Welcome!

Agenda for today: 

- Introductions
- Syllabus
- Lecture 1: Introduction to R, RStudio, and Quarto

## Introductions

Let's start by going around the room and sharing our:

* Name and pronouns

* Program and year

* Experience with programming (in R or generally)

* Your favorite place to eat in Seattle (what do you usually order?)

## Syllabus

The syllabus (as well as lots of other information) can be found on our course website:

<br>

**https://vsass.github.io/CSSS508**

<br>

Feel free to follow along online as I run through the syllabus!

## Course goals

This course is intended to give students a foundational understanding of programming in the statistical language R. General topics include:

:::{.incremental}
* Exploring data with graphics and summaries
* Cleaning, preparing, and linking data for analyses
* Foundational programming skills such as functions and loops
* Organizing projects and creating reproducible research
:::
 . . . 

We won't really cover any statistics in this course but the goal is for you to increase your coding comprehension and learn the tools you need to be able to focus on <i>statistics instead of coding</i> in any future/current CSSS or STAT courses!

## Prerequisites, Materials, and Texts

*Prerequisites:* None

**Materials:** All course materials are provided on the [course website](https://vsass.github.io/CSSS508). This includes:

* These slides and the code used to generate them.
* An R script for the slides to follow along in class.
* Homework instructions and/or templates
* Useful links to other resources.

**Laptops:** It's helpful to bring a laptop to class. If you don't have one, you can use the lab computers or borrow one for free from the [UW Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/).

**Textbooks:** This course has no textbook. However, I will provide optional reading recommendations that I've found really useful!

## Grading 

**Final grade:** Credit/No Credit (C/NC); You need at least 60% to get Credit.

* **Homework** (75%; assessed by peers): 8 total homeworks; assessed on a 0-3 point rubric. Assigned after lectures and due before the following lecture.
* **Peer Grading** (25%; assessed by the instructor): One per homework, assessed on a binary "good"/"not good" scale. Due before the following lab.

Assignment/peer grading instructions and deadlines can be found on the [Homework](https://vsass.github.io/CSSS508/Homework/homework.qmd) page of the course website. All homework will be turned in on Canvas.

## Ugh, peer grading?

Yes, because:

* You will write your reports better knowing others will see them

* You learn alternate approaches to the same problem

* You will have more opportunities to practice and have the material sink in

. . . 

How to peer review:

* Leave **constructive comments**: You'll only get the point if you write at least 1 full paragraph that includes
    + Any key issues from the assignment and,
    + Points out something positive in your peer's work.
* **Email me** if you would like your assignment to be regraded or provide feedback if no peer review was given.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is essential to this course and to your learning. Violations of the academic integrity policy include but are not limited to: 

* Copying from a peer
* Copying from an online resource
* Using resources from a previous iteration of the course. 

. . . 

I hope you will collaborate with peers on assignments and use Internet resources when questions arise to help solve issues. The key is that you **ultimately submit your own work**. 

. . . 

Anything found in violation of this policy will be automatically given a score of 0 with no exceptions. If the situation merits, it will also be reported to the UW Student Conduct Office, at which point it is out of my hands. If you have any questions about this policy, please do not hesitate to reach out and ask.

## Classroom Environment

**I'm committed to fostering a friendly and inclusive classroom environment in which all students have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed.**

. . . 

* Names & Pronouns: Everyone should be addressed respectfully and correctly. Feel free to send me your name/pronouns anytime.

. . . 

* Covid: Covid creates unique circumstances for each of us, which may limit your ability to fully participate in this course. You never need to apologize to me for anything pandemic-related. Let me know how I can help!

. . . 

* Accessibility & Accomodations: See course website for information on health, disability, and religious accomodations.

. . . 

* Feedback: I encourage feedback at any point in the quarter. I will also send out a mid-quarter evaluation around Week 5.

. . . 

* Getting Help: If you ever find yourself struggling, know I'm here to help! Try chatting after class, messaging me on Canvas, or coming to office hours.

## Asking Questions

Don't ask like this:

> tried lm(y~x) but it iddn't work wat do

. . . 

Instead, ask like this: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
y <- seq(1:10) + rnorm(10)
x <- seq(0:10)
model <- lm(y ~ x)
</pre>

Running the block above gives me the following error, anyone know why?

<pre>
Error in model.frame.default(formula = y ~ x, 
drop.unused.levels = TRUE) : variable lengths differ 
(found for 'x')
</pre>
</blockquote>

I may send out your question (anonymously) and my answer to the course mailing list!

## Questions?


## Lecture 1: Introduction to R, RStudio, and Quarto

## A Note on Slide Formatting

**Bold** and *Italics* indicate important terms! 

. . . 

`Code` represents R code you could use to perform actions. For example: "Press `Ctrl-P` to open the print dialogue."

. . . 

Code chunks that span the page represent *actual R code embedded in the slides*.

```{r highlight=TRUE}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1"
# Sometimes important stuff is highlighted!
7 * 49
```

## Why R?

R is a programming language built for statistical computing.

If one already knows Stata or similar software, why use R?

. . . 

* R is *free*.

. . . 

* R has a *very* large community.

. . . 

* R can handle virtually any data format.

. . . 

* R makes replication easy.

. . . 

* R is a *language* so it can do *everything*.

. . . 

* R skills transfer to other languages like Python and Julia.

## R Studio

R Studio is a "front-end" or integrated development environment (IDE) for R that can make your life *easier*.

. . . 

We'll show RStudio can...
. . . 

* Organize your code, output, and plots

. . . 

* Auto-complete code and highlight syntax

. . . 

* Help view data and objects

. . . 

* Enable easy integration of R code into documents with **Quarto**

. . . 

It can also...

* Manage `git` repositories

* Run interactive tutorials

* Handle other languages like C++, Python, SQL, HTML, and shell scripting

## Selling You on Quarto

Built upon many of the developments of the R Markdown ecosystem, Quarto distills them into one coherent system and additionally expands its functionality by supporting other programming languages besides R, including Python and Julia.

## Selling You on Quarto {.scrollable}

The ability to create Quarto files in R is a powerful advantage. It allows us to:

:::{.incremental}
* Document analyses by combining text, code, and output
   + No copying and pasting into Word
   + Easy for collaborators to understand
   + Show as little or as much code as you want
* Produce many different document types as output
  + PDF documents
  + HTML webpages and reports
  + Word and PowerPoint documents  
  + Presentations (like these slides)
  + Books
  + Theses/Dissertations 😉🎓
  + Websites (like the one for [this course](http://vsass.github.io/CSSS508)!)
* Works with LaTeX and HTML for math and more formatting control

## Editing and Running Code

There are several ways to run R code in RStudio:

. . . 

* Highlight lines in the **editor** window and click *Run* at the top or hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter` to run them all.

## Editing and Running Code

There are several ways to run R code in RStudio:

* Highlight lines in the **editor** window and click *Run* at the top or hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter` to run them all.

* With your **caret**^[This thing is the caret: <span class="blink_me">|</span>] on a line you want to run, hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`. Note your caret moves to the next line, so you can run code sequentially with repeated presses.

. . . 

* Type individual lines in the **console** and press `Enter`.

. . . 

* In R Markdown documents, click within a code chunk and click the green arrow to run the chunk. The button beside that runs *all prior chunks*.

. . .

The console will show the lines you ran followed by any printed output.

## Incomplete Code

If you mess up (e.g. leave off a parenthesis), R might show a `+` sign prompting you to finish the command:

```{r Coding 1}
#| eval: false
> (11-2
+
```

Finish the command or hit `Esc` to get out of this.

## R as a Calculator

In the **console**, type `123 + 456 + 789` and hit `Enter`.

. . . 

```{r Calc 1}
123 + 456 + 789
```

. . . 

The `[1]` in the output indicates the numeric **index** of the first element on that line.

. . . 

Now in your blank R document in the **editor**, try typing the line `sqrt(400)` and either
clicking *Run* or hitting `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`.

. . . 

```{r Calc 2}
#| echo: true
sqrt(400)
```

## Functions and Help

`sqrt()` is an example of a **function** in R.

If we didn't have a good guess as to what `sqrt()` will do, we can type `?sqrt` in the console
and look at the **Help** panel on the right.

```{r Help, eval=FALSE}
?sqrt
```

**Arguments** are the *inputs* to a function. In this case, the only argument to `sqrt()`
is `x` which can be a number or a vector of numbers.

Help files provide documentation on how to use functions and what functions produce.

## Objects

R stores everything as an **object**, including data, functions, models, and output.

. . . 

Creating an object can be done using the **assignment operator**: `<-` 
. . . 

```{r Objects 1}
new.object <- 144
```

. . . 

**Operators** like `<-` are functions that look like symbols but typically sit between their arguments 
(e.g. numbers or objects) instead of having them inside `()` like in `sqrt(x)`. 

. . . 

We do math with operators, e.g., `x + y`. `+` is the addition operator!

## Calling Objects

You can display or "call" an object simply by using its name.

```{r Objects 2}
new.object
```

. . . 

Object names can contain `_` and `.` in them but cannot *begin* with numbers. Try
to be consistent in naming objects. RStudio auto-complete means *long names are better 
than vague ones*! 

*Good names save confusion later!*

Object names are **CaSe SeNsItIvE!!**

## Using Objects

An object's **name** represents the information stored in that **object**, so you can treat the object's name
as if it were the values stored inside.
. . . 

```{r Objects 3}
new.object + 10
new.object + new.object
sqrt(new.object)
```

## Vectors

A **vector** is a series of **elements**, such as numbers.

. . . 

You can create a vector using the
function `c()` which stands for "combine" or "concatenate".
. . . 

```{r Vectors 1}
new.object <- c(4, 9, 16, 25, 36)
new.object
```

. . . 

If you name an object the same name as an existing object, *it will overwrite it*.

. . . 

You can provide a vector as an argument for many functions.
. . . 

```{r Vectors 2}
sqrt(new.object)
```

## More Complex Objects

There are other, more complex data types in R which we will discuss later in the quarter! These include **matrices**, **arrays**, **lists**, and **dataframes**.

Most data sets you will work with will be read into R and stored as a **dataframe**, so this course will mainly focus on manipulating and visualizing these objects.

## Quarto

## Quarto Documents

Let's try making an Quarto file:

1. Choose *File > New File > Quarto Document...*
2. Make sure *HTML Output* is selected 
3. In the *Title* box call this test document `my_first_qmd.qmd` and click *Create*
4. Save this document somewhere (you can delete it later) (either with *File > Save* or clicking the 💾 icon towards the top left of the source pane)
4. Click the ➡️*Render* button
5. Watch the progress in the Background Jobs tab of the console pane, then gaze upon your result!

. . . 

If you want to create PDF output in the future, you'll need to run the following code in your console. 

```{r PDFHelp}
#| eval: false
install.packages("quarto")
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

## Quarto Headers

The header of an .qmd file is a code block, and everything else is part of the main document.

. . . 

```{r}
#| eval: false
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Victoria Sass"
date: "October 3, 2023"
output: html_document
---
```

## Quarto Headers

The header of an .qmd file is a code block, and everything else is part of the main document.

```{r}
#| eval: false
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Victoria Sass"
date: "October 3, 2023"
output: html_document
---
```

To mess with global formatting, [you can modify the header](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html)^[Be careful though, YAML is space-sensitive; indents matter!]. 


```{r}
#| eval: false
output:
  html_document:
    theme: readable
```
