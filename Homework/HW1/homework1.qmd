### Instructions

Write up a .Rmd file showing some exploratory analyses of the Swiss fertility data. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html file to Canvas. You must upload both for credit.

Mix in-line R calculations, R output, and plots with text describing the relationships you see. Include at least two plots. You must use in-line R calculations at least once (e.g. functions like nrow(), mean(), sd(), cor(), median(), min()) and may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text.

Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. Use chunk options echo and results to limit the code/output you show in the .html. Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text -- not as printed code and output -- and rounded so as not to be absurdly precise (e.g. round x with round(x, 2)).
