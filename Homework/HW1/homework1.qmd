### Instructions

Write up a .qmd file showing some exploratory analyses of the Swiss fertility data. Upload both the `.qmd` file and the `.html` file to Canvas. You must upload **BOTH** for credit.

Mix in-line R calculations, R output, and plots with text describing the relationships you see. Include *at least* one plot and one table using the `gt` package. You are encouraged to include more! You must use in-line R calculations/references at least once (e.g. functions like `nrow()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, `cor()`, `median()`, `min()`) and *may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text*.

Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. Use chunk options `echo` and `output` to limit the code/output you show in the .html. Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text---*not as printed code and output*---and rounded so as not to be absurdly precise (e.g. round `x` with `round(x, 2)`).
