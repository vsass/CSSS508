### **Overview and Learning Objectives:**

This course is intended to give students a foundational understanding of programming in the statistical language R. This knowledge is intended to be broadly useful wherever you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:

* Develop intermediate data management and visualization skills in R

* Learn basic programming

* Introduce reproducible research practices

* Prepare you for statistics and CSSS courses

By the end of this course you should feel confident approaching any data you encounter in the future. We will cover almost no statistics, however it is the intention that this course will leave you prepared to progress in CS&SS or STAT courses with the ability to focus on statistics instead of coding. Additionally, the basic concepts you learn will be applicable to other programming languages and research in general, such as logic and algorithmic thinking.

### **Structure:**

This course has a primary lecture session, a lab session, and office hours:

-   **Lecture (in-person; 50 minutes):** On Tuesdays, I will lead a collaborative session on a specific topic to help you learn fundamental skills, concepts, and principles for learning R. The content from lecture each week will be the basis of the homework assignment due the following week.

-   **Lab (in-person; 50 minutes):** On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we will meet in the CSSCR lab for an interactive session where we will practice the skills from lecture. Students will work with each other to learn and practice key skills in R, but I will be available to help as well!

-   **Office Hours (remote; one 2 hour session):** On Thursdays, I will hold drop-in office hours on Zoom. This is a great time to ask questions, get advice, or continue discussions from lab/lecture. We can talk in a breakout room or with the group! A link to the Zoom meeting can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1665088).

This course will have no meeting during final exam week.

### **Prerequisites:**

This course has no prerequisites.

### **Materials and Texts:**

This course has no required materials or texts. However, there are a few things to note:

-   **Laptops:** This course is primarily focused on computation. As a result, it is helpful to bring a personal laptop to class each day. Alternatively, you can use one of the computers available in the classroom (Savery 117, aka the "CSSCR Big Lab"). If you'd like a laptop but do not have one, you can borrow one for free from UW through the [Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/).

-   **Online Textbooks:** This course has no required textbooks, but there are many helpful resources available for free online. Two of my favorites are the textbook [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham and the collection of short [R Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) by the folks at RStudio.

### **Grading**

This course is graded as credit/no credit. To pass you need to receive at least 60% of the available points. There will be 8 graded homework assignments, one nearly every week. There are 4 points possible for each week that features a homework.

-   **Homework (75%; 3 points):** These must be turned in as knitted Markdown documents which we will learn to create and for which templates are provided. They will be graded on a 0 to 3 point scale based on a simple effort-focused rubric found on the course website. These are designed first and foremost to develop skills rather than \"prove\" you have learned concepts. I encourage you to communicate and work together, so long as you write and explain your code yourself and do not copy work. You can learn a lot from replicating others\' code, but you will learn nothing if you copy it without knowing how it works! In other words, you're not really going to learn unless you do the coding yourself!

-   **Peer Review (25%; 1 point):** Each week an assignment is due, students will be randomly assigned to grade another student\'s assignment following a 0 to 3 rubric. They will be expected to provide constructive feedback and commentary if something new was learned. Reading others\' code is an important skill and you will write better code knowing others will see it. These reviews will be due prior to the following class meeting. Each peer review is worth 1 point and will be evaluated by the instructor on a binary \"good\" / \"not good\" scale.

### **Classroom Environment**

***I am absolutely committed to fostering a friendly and inclusive classroom environment in which all students have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed.***

-   **Names & Pronouns:** Everyone deserves to be addressed respectfully and correctly. You are welcome to send me your preferred name and correct gender pronouns at any time. I will also provide an opportunity to share your preferred name and pronouns in-class on the first day!

-   **Covid Considerations:** I will follow all University rules and procedures regarding Covid, which may or may not change during the quarter. I also recognize that Covid creates unique circumstances and concerns for each of us, which may limit your ability to fully attend or participate in this course. You never need to apologize to me for anything pandemic related. If there is something I can do to make you feel more comfortable during class, please let me know!

-   **Getting Help:** If at any point during the quarter you find yourself struggling to keep up, please let me know! I am here to help. A great place to start this process is by chatting after class, coming to office hours, or sending me an email.

-   **Feedback:** I encourage and appreciate your feedback. Please feel welcome to contact me via email with feedback at any point during or after the quarter. Additionally, I will send out a mid-quarter feedback survey on Canvas around Week 5.

-   **Diversity:** Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of university education. Therefore, I expect you to follow the UW Student Conduct Code in your interactions with your colleagues and me in this course by respecting the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and presentation, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.

-   **Accessibility & Accommodations:** Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924, uwdrs\@uw.edu, or through their [website](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/). DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.

-   **Academic Integrity:** Academic integrity is essential to this course and to your learning. In this course, violations of the academic integrity policy include but are not limited to: copying from a peer, copying from an online resource, or using resources from a previous iteration of the course. That said, I hope you will collaborate with peers on assignments, and use Internet resources when questions arise to help solve issues. The key is that you ultimately submit your own work. Anything found in violation of this policy will be automatically given a score of 0 with no exceptions. If the situation merits, it will also be reported to the [UW Student Conduct Office](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/), at which point it is out of my hands. If you have any questions about this policy, please do not hesitate to reach out and ask.

-   **Religious Accommodations:** Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW\'s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).
