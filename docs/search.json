    "text": "Code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\n\nAnswer 1\nChoose an airport outside New York, and count how many flights went to that airport from NYC in 2013. How many of those flights started at JFK, LGA, and EWR respectively?\n\n\nCode\nsd_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; \n  filter(dest == \"SAN\") |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n(), \n1            .by = origin)\n\n\n\n1\n\nAn alternative to this summarize call would be to call count(origin).\n\n\n\n\nThere were 2,737 total flights from New York to San Diego. 1,603 of those flights originated from JFK and 1,134 from EWR.1\n1 To add various punctuation to inline numeric values try the number function from the scales package.\n\nAnswer 2\nThe variable arr_delay contains arrival delays in minutes (negative values represent early arrivals). Make a ggplot histogram displaying arrival delays for 2013 flights from NYC to the airport you chose.\n\n\nCode\nflights |&gt; \n  filter(dest == \"SAN\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = arr_delay)) +\n  geom_histogram() + \n1  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"#e15759\") +\n  labs(title = \"Arrival delays from NYC airports to SAN in 2013\",\n       x = \"Arrival delays (minutes)\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_tufte(base_size = 14) + \n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f6f7f9\", \n2                                       color = NA))\n\n\n\n1\n\ngeom_vline adds a vertical line to your plot which can be useful for demarcating comparison or threshold values.\n\n2\n\nChanging the background color of my plot to match the website’s color using fill and removing the border of the plot using color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 3\nUse left_join to add weather data at departure to the subsetted data. If time_hour didn’t exist in one or both of these datasets, which variables would you need to merge on? Calculate the mean temperature by month at departure (temp) across all flights.\n\n\nCode\nflights |&gt; \n  filter(dest == \"SAN\") |&gt; \n  left_join(weather) |&gt; \n1  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE) |&gt; round(2) |&gt; number(suffix = \"°F\"),\n            .by = month) |&gt; \n  arrange(month) |&gt; \n2  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_align(align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_label(month = \"Month\",\n             avg_temp = \"Average Temperature\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(table.background.color = \"#f6f7f9\")\n\n\n\n1\n\nWhen creating the mean temperature I also chose to round to two decimal places with round() and add the suffix °F with the number function from the scales package. This level of detail is not necessary for this assignment but it illustrates additional options available to you in the scales package.\n\n2\n\nMaking the table a bit nicer looking (again, not necessary here)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nAverage Temperature\n\n\n\n\n1\n37°F\n\n\n2\n36°F\n\n\n3\n41°F\n\n\n4\n54°F\n\n\n5\n64°F\n\n\n6\n74°F\n\n\n7\n82°F\n\n\n8\n77°F\n\n\n9\n70°F\n\n\n10\n61°F\n\n\n11\n46°F\n\n\n12\n40°F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf time_hour didn’t exist in one of both of these datasets you would have to join on origin, year, month, day, and hour.\n\n\nAnswer 4\nInvestigate if there is a relationship between departure delay (dep_delay) and precipitation (precip) in the full dataset. Is the relationship different between JFK, LGA, and EWR? I suggest answering this question by making a plot and writing down a one-sentence interpretation2.\n2 Hint: Read about geom_smooth() and consider how you might use it with the argument method = \"lm\" to plot a relationship between these two variables.\n\nCode\nflights |&gt; \n  left_join(weather) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = precip, \n             y = dep_delay)) + \n1  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n2  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(title = \"Does precipitation increase the likelihood of departure delays?\",\n       x = \"Precipitation (in inches)\",\n       y = \"Departure delay (in minutes)\") + \n  theme_tufte(base_size = 14) + \n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f6f7f9\", \n                                       color = NA))\n\n\n\n1\n\nIt can be helpful to make all points transparent if there is extreme over-plotting like in this plot. It allows you see more clearly see where there is over-plotting.\n\n2\n\nAdding a regression line allows for better visualization of the relationship between precipitation and departure delays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like there is a slightly positive relationship between precipitation and the length of a departure delay.\n\n\nCode\nflights |&gt; \n  left_join(weather) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = precip, \n             y = dep_delay, \n1             color = origin,\n             linetype = origin)) +\n2  geom_jitter(shape = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", \n              fill = \"#f6f7f9\") + \n3  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"EWR\" = \"#fdc57e\",\n                                \"JFK\" = \"#648f7b\",\n                                \"LGA\" = \"#66629c\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Does precipitation increase the likelihood of departure delays?\",\n       x = \"Precipitation (in inches)\",\n       y = \"Departure delay (in minutes)\") + \n  theme_tufte(base_size = 14) + \n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f6f7f9\", \n                                       color = NA), \n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n1\n\nJust added the mapping aesthetic by color and linetype to visualize this by origin airport.\n\n2\n\nAn alternative to using alpha to facilitate viewing over-plotted points is to use a shape that only applies color to the outline, rather than the whole point shape.\n\n3\n\nAdding custom colors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen broken down by origin airport it looks like this slight positive association is just a bit larger for JFK and LGA than it is for EWR."

My name is Vic\" or \"%*$#01234\"\n\nYou can create a string using either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (\" \")\n\nIn the interest of consistency, the tidyverse style guide recommends using \" \", unless the string contains multiple \" \". In that case it is recommended to use ' ' to define the entire string and \" \" for elements within the string that are themselves quoted."

    "section": "Escaping with Strings",
    "text": "Escaping with Strings\nWe use a lot of different symbols in our code that we might actually want to represent within a string itself. To do that, we need to escape that particular character. We can do that using \\.\n\nFor instance, if we want to include a literal single or double quote in our string, we’d escape it by writing:\n\n1\"\\'\"\n2'\\\"'\n\n\n1\n\nSingle quote.\n\n2\n\nDouble quote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, if we want to represent a \\ we’ll need to escape it as well…\n\n3\"\\\\\"\n\n\n3\n\nBackslash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: When you print these objects you’ll see the escape characters. To actually view the string’s contents ( and not the syntax needed to construct it), use str_view().\n\n\n\n4str_view(c(\"\\'\", '\\\"', \"\\\\\"))\n\n\n4\n\nAll stringr functions begin with the prefix str_ which is useful due to R Studio’s auto-complete feature.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; [1] │ '\n&gt; [2] │ \"\n&gt; [3] │ \\"

You’ll notice that all of the str_* functions go inside a dplyr function, such as mutate, filter, etc. That’s because they operate on the level of a vector, not a dataframe. These separate_* functions, however, work like dplyr functions in that they operate directly on a column of data so you can pipe a data frame directly to them."

    "text": "What are Regular Expressions? \nRegular expressions1 or regexes are how we describe patterns we are looking for in text in a way that a computer can understand. We write an expression, apply it to a string input, and then can do things with matches we find.\n\n\nLiteral characters are defined snippets to search for like Pike or 01/.\n\n\n\n\nMetacharacters2 let us be flexible in describing patterns. Some basic types of metacharacters are listed below.\n\nQuantifiers control how many times a pattern can match\n\n? makes a pattern optional (i.e. it matches 0 or 1 times)\n+ lets a pattern repeat (i.e. it matches at least once)\n* lets a pattern be optional or repeat (i.e. it matches any number of times, including 0)\n{n} matches exactly n times, {n,} matches at least n times, {n, m} matches between n and m times\n\nCharacter classes are defined by [] and let you match a set of characters\n\n. matches any character except a new line (\\n)\n- allows you to specify a range\nYou can invert a match by starting it with ^\n\nGrouping allows you to override the default precedence rules for regular expressions\n\n() also allows you to create groups which can be referenced later in the regular expression with backreferences, like \\1, \\2\nUse (?:), the non-grouping parentheses, to control precedence but not capture the match in a group. This is slightly more efficient than capturing parentheses and most useful for complex cases where you need to capture matches and control precedence independently.\n\nAlternation, |, allows us to pick between one or more alternative patterns\nAnchors allow you to add specificity as to where the match occurs\n\nUse ^ to anchor the start\nUse $ to anchor the end\nMatch the boundary between words (start or end) with \\b\n\nLookarounds look ahead or behind the current match without “consuming” any characters. These are useful when you want to check that a pattern exists, but you don’t want to include it in the result.\n\n(?=...) is a positive look-ahead assertion. Matches if ... matches at the current input\n(?!...) is a negative look-ahead assertion. Matches if ... does not match at the current input\n(?&lt;=...) is a positive look-behind assertion. Matches if ... matches text preceding the current position. Length must be bounded (i.e. no * or +)\n(?&lt;!...) is a negative look-behind assertion. Matches if ... does not match text preceding the current position. Length must be bounded (i.e. no * or +)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about regular expressions in stringr here and this is a useful tutorial to learn regex if you need to/when you’re ready!\n\n\nRegular expressions are very compact and use a lot of punctuation characters, so they can seem overwhelming and hard to read at first. DO NOT prioritize learning this right now, especially if you are still a beginner! This information is for future reference and to give you a sense of what you can do if you need/want to work with text data in the future.To treat a metacharacter as a literal character, you must escape it with two preceding backslashes \\\\, e.g. to match (206) including the parentheses, you’d use \\\\(206\\\\) in your regex."

These separate_* functions, however, work like dplyr functions in that they operate directly on a column of data so you can pipe a data frame directly to them.↩︎\nIf you need to use the separate_longer_* functions, you can read more about them here.↩︎\nYou can see which are supported in stringr by looking at stringi::stri_locale_list()↩︎\nRegular expressions are very compact and use a lot of punctuation characters, so they can seem overwhelming and hard to read at first. DO NOT prioritize learning this right now, especially if you are still a beginner! This information is for future reference and to give you a sense of what you can do if you need/want to work with text data in the future.↩︎\nTo treat a metacharacter as a literal character, you must escape it with two preceding backslashes \\\\, e.g. to match (206) including the parentheses, you’d use \\\\(206\\\\) in your regex.↩︎\nYou can see a full list here, including functions we didn’t look at today.↩︎\nHint, each name has a proportion that is necessary to incorporate here.↩︎\nHint: Use pull() before running str_view() to extract the last column created (your sentence) as a vector.↩︎\nHint, each name has a proportion that is necessary to account for here.↩︎\nHint: Use pull() before running str_view() to extract the last column created (your sentence) as a vector.↩︎"

This knowledge is intended to be broadly useful wherever you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:\n\nDeveloping intermediate data management and visualization skills\nOrganizing projects and creating reproducible research\nCleaning data\nLinking multiple data sets together\nLearning basic programming skills\n\n\nBy the end of this course you should feel confident approaching any data you encounter in the future. We will cover almost no statistics, however it is the intention that this course will leave you prepared to progress in CS&SS or STAT courses with the ability to focus on statistics instead of coding. Additionally, the basic concepts you learn will be applicable to other programming languages and research in general, such as logic and algorithmic thinking."

But keep in mind that they often make mistakes — and sometimes confidently give you flawed, biased, and/or suboptimal code. If you don’t understand the basics, fixing those mistakes can be more work than writing the code yourself. Think of AI as a study aid — useful for clarification and explanations — but if you rely on it too much, it can actually hold back your learning and even weaken your coding skills over time.

You can change the default behavior by setting the .groups argument to a different value, e.g., \"drop\" to drop all grouping or \"keep\" to preserve the same groups. The default is \"drop_last\" if all groups have 1 row and keep otherwise (it’s recommended to use reframe() if this is the case, which is a more general version of summarize() that allows for an arbitrary number of rows per group and drops all grouping variables after execution)."

I wonder how this varies by species…?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from this plot that the overall mean and median of petal length is quite misleading! Only the verisicolor species of iris is close to those values while setosa is much mush smaller and virginica is a bit bigger.\nIs there a similar thing happening for sepal length and width? Let’s look at some basic descriptives of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\nMin. :4.300\nMin. :2.000\nMin. :1.000\nMin. :0.100\nsetosa :50\n\n\n1st Qu.:5.100\n1st Qu.:2.800\n1st Qu.:1.600\n1st Qu.:0.300\nversicolor:50\n\n\nMedian :5.800\nMedian :3.000\nMedian :4.350\nMedian :1.300\nvirginica :50\n\n\nMean :5.843\nMean :3.057\nMean :3.758\nMean :1.199\nNA\n\n\n3rd Qu.:6.400\n3rd Qu.:3.300\n3rd Qu.:5.100\n3rd Qu.:1.800\nNA\n\n\nMax. :7.900\nMax. :4.400\nMax. :6.900\nMax. :2.500\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to note with the summary function that for numerical data it’ll calculate the classic 5 statistics used to construct a boxplot plus the mean but for a categorical variable like iris$Species it returns the frequency of each value of the variable.\nThe distribution of sepal length looks wider than sepal width, similar to how it was for those measurements of the petals. Let’s see how sepal length and width relate to one another graphically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are still clusters by each species type but for verisicolor and virginica there’s much more overlap. Overall, there’s tighter clustering by species for the petal length and width than there is for the sepal length and width."

Use LETTERS and [ ] to create a vector called vec_char of the first 10 capital letters.\nletters contains the 26 lowercase letters in order. Use factor, letters, and [ ] to create a factor variable called vec_fac using the last 10 lower case letters.\nUse rev() to reverse the order of vec_fac.\nIf you used c() to combine vec_fac with a vector of integers, what class of vector would you get? Why?\nConsider the vector c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE). In words, what happens to its values when you try to convert it to numeric? To character? To numeric and then character?\n\n2 LETTERS and letters are built-in vectors in R that you can use without loading any external packages.\n\nQuestion 2: Matrices\n\nUse matrix() to create a matrix called matrix_mixed with 10 rows and four columns filled with NA. What data type does this matrix contain3?\nAdd the numbers 1 through 10 to the first column of this empty matrix and get it’s data type.\nAdd 10 random deviates from the normal distribution4 to the second column and get it’s data type.\nAssign vec_char and vec_fac to the third and fourth columns of matrix_mixed using one assignment operator. What is the data type of the matrix now?\nExplain this progression of data types from part i to part iv.\nLook at matrix_mixed. What happened to the letters in column 4?\nRun this code in your console: matrix(letters, ncol = 2). It consists of letters a to m in the first column and n to z in the second column. How can you change this code to make it go in alphabetical order left to right, top to bottom instead?\nConsider the code below:\n\n3 Use typeof() to find this.4 Using rnorm().\nmath_matrix &lt;- matrix(1:5, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)\nmath_vec &lt;- 1:5\n\nWhat happens when you add math_matrix and math_vec to one another?

Note: for whichever folder you set as a project(s) you will have a .Rproj file which maintains specific project settings. That project folder is your default working directory when you’re doing any work within this folder (including within subfolders). Individual .qmd files will have a working directory of the specific folder they are in when they are rendered.

If you already have a folder for this class you can retroactively turn it into a project by selecting File &gt; New Project… &gt; Existing Directory and browsing to that folder2.\nCreating a folder for this class and make weekly sub-folders which are each, themselves, projects.3 You would need to retroactively make week 1 and 2 folders projects by using this method. For any new weekly folders you can directly create that directory by selecting File &gt; New Project… &gt; New Directory\n\nCreate your .qmd for this homework within your new project4.\nWhen you’re done organizing the folder for this class, write out its current organizational structure (i.e. something similar to the solution to lab question 55 with the specific names for files and folders that you used). Write a one-sentence description of how you’ve organized your project/projects for this class.\n\n\n2 Note: this approach will complicate your file path specification since markdown documents internally set the working directory to the folder they are in when they knit. That will be at odds with the working directory of your project, (one folder-level up from each of your homework assignment .qmds). If you’d like to use this method for organizing your folders/files, you should familiarize yourself with the here package to limit file path frustration and enable you to set up more complex projects in the future.3 I highly recommend this approach if the concept of relative versus absolute paths is new(er) to you. If each homework is its own project, your working directory will be set directly to that homework folder which will make relative file paths work whether you’re running code interactively or knitting your .qmd since they will be the same.4 You’ll notice that the upper-right hand corner of your RStudio IDE now displays the name of that new project.

For homework-specific instructions and templates go to the specific assignment listed on the left.\n\n\nA Note About Rendering Your HTML documents\nYou need to include embed-resources: true in your YAML header in order for your HTML documents to include any plot output when you upload them to Canvas. It should look something like the following:\n\nYou can read more about this option here but basically, whenever you render a .qmd file to HTML, all output created goes into a separate, associated folder, which is referenced when displaying the page in your web browser. However, when you upload the HTML file separately from that folder (e.g. to Canvas or through email), it doesn’t have the specific output images to reference, so they won’t appear. When you specify in your YAML header that you want to embed resources, you’re explicitly adding the output created by your code to the HTML file so that a separate output folder is longer created and you can send your HTML file with all its output as one entity.\n\n\nAssignment Due Dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nHomework Due\nPeer Review Due\n\n\n\n\n1\n7 October\n12 October\n\n\n2\n14 October\n19 October\n\n\n3\n21 October\n26 October\n\n\n4\n28 October\n2 November\n\n\n5\n11 November1\n16 November\n\n\n6\n18 November2\n23 November\n\n\n7\n25 November\n30 November\n\n\n8\n2 December\n7 December\n\n\n9\n9 December\n14 December\n\n\n\n1 You will have two weeks to complete Homework 5\n\n\n2 We will cover content for Homework 6 two weeks prior to its due date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll assignments should be created using Quarto and uploaded to Canvas as both html and qmd files. Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at and follow all instructions. Use sections for organization, label figures/tables, and use code chunks.\n\n\nRubric Students Use to Grade Assignments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nDidn’t turn anything in.\n0\n\n\nTurned in but low effort,  ignoring many directions.\n1\n\n\nDecent effort, followed directions  with some minor issues.\n2\n\n\nNailed it!\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer Review:\nYou are required to both grade and provide feedback on a peer’s homework each week. Reading/evaluating the work of others is useful and important! Good programmers realize that most problems have been solved by others; the trick is figuring out how to apply existing code to new problems. You will develop this skill by reading others’ code, evaluating their approach to problems, providing suggestions, and pointing out when you learned something new. Poor peer reviews are impolite or unprofessional, are generic (i.e., could be applied to anyone’s homework), or fail to provide useful suggestions. Good peer reviews give constructive, polite, and insightful comments, are specific and concise, use the grading rubric above, and point out what you learned from their code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Homework Will Automatically Lose Peer-Review Credit\n\n\n\nPeer reviews are randomly assigned when the due date/time is reached. Therefore, if you don’t submit your homework on time, you will not be given a peer’s homework to review and vice versa. That said, life is messy and complicated and we all miss deadlines for a variety of reasons. Therefore, you can request that I review and provide feedback on a late assignment (message me on Slack) but you won’t be able to earn peer-review credit for that particular homework.\n\n\n\n\nRubric Instructor Uses to Grade Peer Review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nDidn’t follow all peer-review instructions.\n0\n\n\nPeer review is at least several sentences long, mentions any and all key issues from the assignment, and points out at least one positive thing in your peer’s work (and hopefully more!).\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Contact the Instructor:\nA number of situations may warrant contacting the instructor:\n\nIf you believe you have received an unfair peer review, you can request for evaluation by the instructor. The assignment will be regraded, which may result in a higher, same, or lower grade.\nIf you wish for more feedback on a particular part of the homework, you can ask the instructor for additional explanation during office hours or over Slack.\nIf you receive no feedback, I will provide peer review by request.",

    "text": "This syllabus is subject to change. All changes will be announced both in class, on Slack, and on this page.\n\nCourse Info:\nInstructor: Victoria (Vic) Sass\nLecture: Tuesdays 4:30-6:20pm\nLocation: Raitt 121\nOffice Hours: Wednesdays 1pm-3pm on Zoom (link on Canvas)\n\n\nOverview and Learning Objectives:\nThis course is intended to give students a foundational understanding of programming in the statistical language R. This knowledge is intended to be broadly useful wherever you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:\n\nDeveloping intermediate data management and visualization skills in R\nOrganizing projects and creating reproducible research\nCleaning data\nLinking multiple data sets together\nLearning basic programming skills\n\nBy the end of this course you should feel confident approaching any data you encounter in the future. We will cover almost no statistics, however it is the intention that this course will leave you prepared to progress in CS&SS or STAT courses with the ability to focus on statistics instead of coding. Additionally, the basic concepts you learn will be applicable to other programming languages and research in general, such as logic and algorithmic thinking.\n\n\nStructure:\nThis course has a hands-on lecture and drop-in office hours, each once a week:\n\nLecture: On Tuesdays we will meet for an interactive session where we’ll cover a specific topic to help you learn fundamental skills, concepts, and principles for learning R. Additionally, these sessions will provide you with the opportunity to work with each other to learn and practice key skills in R. I will be available to answer questions and help troubleshoot code as well.\nOffice Hours (remote; one 2-hour session): On Wednesdays, I will hold drop-in office hours on Zoom from 1-3pm. This is a great time to ask questions, get advice, or continue discussions from lecture. We can talk in a breakout room or with the group! A link to the Zoom meeting can be found on Canvas.\n\n\n\nSchedule:\nBelow is a summary of topics that will be covered each week in lecture.\n\n\nSeptember 30\n\nOctober 7\n\nOctober 14\n\nOctober 21\n\nOctober 28\n\nNovember 4\n\nNovember 11\n\nNovember 18\n\nNovember 25\n\nDecember 2\n\nDecember 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1: Introduction to R, RStudio, and Quarto\n\nWeek 2: Visualizing Data\n\nWeek 3: Workflow and Reproducibility\n\nWeek 4: Importing, Exporting, and Cleaning Data\n\nWeek 5: Manipulating and Summarizing Data\n\nWeek 6: Data Structures & Types\n\nVeterans Day Holiday (No Class)\n\nWeek 7: Working with Text Data\n\nWeek 8: Writing Functions\n︎\nWeek 9: Iteration\n\nWeek 10: Next Steps (optional, based on students’ interest) \n\n\n\nThis course has no scheduled meeting during final exam week but if enough students are interested in attending a remote lecture about how to progress further with R, an optional final lecture will be offered.\n\n\nPrerequisites:\nThis course has no prerequisites.\n\n\nMaterials and Texts:\nThis course has no required materials or texts. However, there are a few things to note:\n\nComputers: This course is primarily focused on computation. You’re expected to bring a personal laptop to class as it helps to gain familiarity with the software you’ll be using and gaining hands-on experience with the material we’re learning. If you don’t have access to a laptop you can loan one from UW through the Student Technology Loan Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep In Mind\n\n\n\nThe versions of R, RStudio, and Quarto (as well as any packages you have installed) will not necessarily be the same/up to date if you do your work on different computers. My advice is to consistently use the same device for homework assignments or to make sure to download the latest versions of R, RStudio, and Quarto when using a new machine.\n\n\n\nOnline Textbooks: This course has no required textbooks, but there are many helpful resources available for free online. I will be suggesting selections from R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, & Garrett Grolemund to pair with each week’s topic. While not required, I strongly suggest reading those selections before doing the homework for that week.\n\n\n\nTools for Class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Communication\n\n\n\nLearning is collaborative! In addition to being the place to communicate with me, our Slack is also where you can ask one another questions, share resources, and just generally check in with each other about how your adventures with R are going. You can find the link to join our workplace on our course Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Homework & Peer-Reviews\n\n\n\nWe will be using Canvas solely for homework & peer review submissions/deadlines and for any links I only want to distribute to those registered for this class (i.e. Slack and Office Hours Zoom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Course Content\n\n\n\nAll course content will be accessible on this website.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nThis course is graded as credit/no credit. To pass you need to receive at least 60% of the available points. There will be 9 graded homework assignments: one for each week of content (except week 10). There are 4 points possible for each week that features a homework.\n\nHomework (75%; 3 points): These must be turned in as rendered Markdown documents which we will learn to create and for which templates are provided. They will be graded on a 0 to 3 point scale based on a simple effort-focused rubric found on the course website. These are designed first and foremost to develop skills rather than \"prove\" you have learned concepts. I encourage you to communicate and work together, so long as you write and explain your code yourself and do not copy work. You can learn a lot from replicating others' code, but you will learn nothing if you copy it without knowing how it works! In other words, you’re not really going to learn unless you do the coding yourself!1\nPeer Review (25%; 1 point): Each week an assignment is due, students will be randomly assigned to grade another student's assignment following a 0 to 3 rubric. They will be expected to provide constructive feedback and commentary if something new was learned. Reading others' code is an important skill and you will write better code knowing others will see it. These reviews will be due 5 days after homework is due. Each peer review is worth 1 point and will be evaluated by the instructor on a binary satisfactory/not satisfactory scale.\nSchedule: We have a 2-hour interactive lecture/lab session on Tuesdays. Office Hours will be be held on Wednesdays. Homeworks will be due before class each Tuesday and peer reviews will be due 5 days later, by end-of-day on Sundays. Make sure to check the homework page or Canvas for all due dates!\n\n1 Note: AI tools can be helpful while you’re learning R, especially for asking clarifying questions about what code is doing. But keep in mind that they often make mistakes — and sometimes confidently give you flawed, biased, and/or suboptimal code. If you don’t understand the basics, fixing those mistakes can be more work than writing the code yourself. Think of AI as a study aid — useful for clarification and explanations — but if you rely on it too much, it can actually hold back your learning and even weaken your coding skills over time. The real learning happens when you practice coding on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Homework Will Automatically Lose Peer-Review Credit\n\n\n\nPeer reviews are randomly assigned when the due date/time is reached. Therefore, if you don’t submit your homework on time, you will not be given a peer’s homework to review and vice versa. That said, life is messy and complicated and we all miss deadlines for a variety of reasons. Therefore, you can request that I review and provide feedback on a late assignment (message me on Slack) but you won’t be able to earn peer-review credit for that particular homework.\n\n\n\n\nClassroom Environment\nI’m committed to fostering a friendly and inclusive classroom environment in which all students have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed. This course is an attempt to make an often difficult and frustrating experience (learning R for the first time) less obfuscating, daunting, and stressful. That said, learning happens in different ways at at a different pace for everyone. Learning is also a collaborative and creative process and my aim is to create an environment in which you all feel comfortable asking questions of me and each other. Treat your peers and yourself with empathy and respect as you all approach this topic from a range of backgrounds and experiences (in programming and in life).\n\nNames & Pronouns: Everyone deserves to be addressed respectfully and correctly. You are welcome to send me your preferred name and correct gender pronouns at any time.\nGetting Help: If at any point during the quarter you find yourself struggling to keep up, please let me know! I am here to help. A great place to start this process is by chatting before class, coming to office hours, or sending me a message on Slack.\nDiversity: Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of university education. Therefore, I expect you to follow the UW Student Conduct Code in your interactions with your colleagues and me in this course by respecting the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and presentation, body size/shape, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.\nAccessibility & Accommodations: Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924, uwdrs@uw.edu, or through their website. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, me (your instructor), and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.\nAcademic Integrity: Academic integrity is essential to this course and to your learning. In this course, violations of the academic integrity policy include but are not limited to: copying from a peer, copying from an online resource, or using resources from a previous iteration of the course. That said, I hope you will collaborate with peers on assignments, and use Internet resources when questions arise to help solve issues. The key is that you ultimately submit your own work. Anything found in violation of this policy will be automatically given a score of 0 with no exceptions. If the situation merits, it will also be reported to the UW Student Conduct Office, at which point it is out of my hands. If you have any questions about this policy, please do not hesitate to reach out and ask.\nReligious Accommodations: Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\nIf you have feedback on any part of this course or the classroom environment I want to hear it! You can message me directly on Slack or send me an anonymous message here. Additionally, I will send out a mid-quarter feedback survey on Slack around Week 5."

Once you come up with a theme you like you can save it as an object (i.e. my_theme) and add it to any ggplot you create to maintain your own unique and consistent style."

Hint: start with the data set created in question 3. An example of what this could look like for April is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This example plot is an extremely specified and polished version of what this can look like. There are a number of ways this can look and you should not be graded nor grade lower for aesthetic features that many of you are still learning. The takeaway here is to challenge yourself to figure out the code to create something that can plot the entire trajectory of the songs that reached the top 3 in whatever month you choose. This will require a combination of the skills you’ve learned in this class thus far. Try this with the content available from lecture first. If you get stuck, there is a hint you can reveal below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Click for skeleton code you can fill in\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This is how I did this problem but there are many approaches to every coding puzzle in R. If this skeleton code is useful, use it. If not, I’m happy to chat through your approach in office hours 🤓\nReplace all instances of function, variable, and value with what you think the correct answer should be.

Given that we’re interested in the Billboard Top 100 for 2000 it might be useful to have a variable that allows us to discriminate between years.\n\n3\n\nTo create some indicator of top 3 status you’ll need to provide two conditions (one variable needs to be less than or equal to a certain value and another needs to equal a certain value)\n\n4\n\nNeed to create a variable that reflects when a particular song charted in the top 3 and NA otherwise\n\n5\n\nIn order to get the entire trajectory of a song we can’t simply filter for the month when it peaked. Then we’d only be able to plot that snippet of its trajectory. Hint: Which function returns TRUE if even 1 element it’s given is TRUE (look back at the logical operators section of lecture 3’s slides)?\n\n6\n\nLoad if you want to add non-overlapping labels for the song name (ggplot’s own geom_text or geom_label can also be used if that’s not an issue for your trajectories).\n\n7\n\nYou want to visualize the ranking trajectory of a song over time. Hint: group is the variable you want to visualize.\n\n8\n\nWhat geometry would be appropriate here?\n\n9\n\nTo properly label this plot you’ll need to subset the data so there is only one observation per song; otherwise it will try to plot a label for every date available.

Therefore, we will need a variable for year as well so we make sure we’re finding the songs that charted in the months of 2000.\n\n3\n\nTo create our top3 indicator we provide the two conditions that the rank for that observation is less than or equal to 3 AND the year is 2000. If so, top3 will be assigned a value of 1 and if not it will get a value of 0.\n\n4\n\nTo filter for the most weeks in the top 3 we need to count how many weeks a song was in the top 3, grouped by month, song, and artist.\n\n5\n\nThen, by month we can slice the song(s) with the most weeks in the top 3.\n\n6\n\nNow we just want the name of the artist, song, the month they were charting in the top 3 for the most weeks, and the number of weeks\n\n7\n\nTo see this in chronological order we want to arrange by the month\n\n\n\n\n&gt; # A tibble: 19 × 4\n&gt;    month artist              track                   peak_weeks\n&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;\n&gt;  1     1 Aguilera, Christina What A Girl Wants                3\n&gt;  2     2 Savage Garden       I Knew I Loved You               4\n&gt;  3     3 Lonestar            Amazed                           4\n&gt;  4     4 Hill, Faith         Breathe                          5\n&gt;  5     4 Santana             Maria, Maria                     5\n&gt;  6     5 Hill, Faith         Breathe                          4\n&gt;  7     5 Santana             Maria, Maria                     4\n&gt;  8     6 Aaliyah             Try Again                        2\n&gt;  9     6 Anthony, Marc       You Sang To Me                   2\n&gt; 10     6 Hill, Faith         Breathe                          2\n&gt; 11     6 Santana             Maria, Maria                     2\n&gt; 12     6 Vertical Horizon    Everything You Want              2\n&gt; 13     7 Aaliyah             Try Again                        4\n&gt; 14     8 Sisqo               Incomplete                       4\n&gt; 15     8 matchbox twenty     Bent                             4\n&gt; 16     9 Janet               Doesn't Really Matte...          5\n&gt; 17    10 Madonna             Music                            4\n&gt; 18    11 Creed               With Arms Wide Open              4\n&gt; 19    12 Destiny's Child     Independent Women Pa...          5\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 5\nPick one month of 2000 and visualize the entire charting trajectory of the songs that spent at least 1 week in the top 3 during that month.\n\n\nCode\nbillboard_top3_month_viz &lt;- billboard_tidy_date |&gt; \n  mutate(month = month(date),\n         year = year(date),\n         top3 = if_else(rank &lt;= 3 & year == 2000, 1, 0)) |&gt; \n1  mutate(month_peak = ifelse(top3 == 1, month, NA),\n         .by = c(month, artist, track)) |&gt; \n2  filter(any(month_peak == 4),\n         .by = c(track, artist)) \n\nggplot(billboard_top3_month_viz, aes(date, rank, group = track, color = artist)) + \n3  annotate(geom = \"rect\", xmin = ymd(\"2000-04-01\"), xmax = ymd(\"2000-05-01\"), ymin = 0, ymax = 85,\n           fill = \"#59a14f\", alpha = 0.25) +\n4  geom_line(show.legend = TRUE) +\n5  geom_label_repel(data = billboard_top3_month_viz |&gt; slice_max(date, by = track),\n                   aes(label = track), \n6                   show.legend = FALSE) +\n7  scale_color_manual(\"Artist\", values = c(\"#4e79a7\",\"#f28e2c\",\"#e15759\",\"#76b7b2\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Billboard Top 100 Trajectory for Songs that Hit Top 3 During April 2000\", \n       x = \"Date\", \n       y = \"Rank\", \n       caption = \"Note: April shaded in green\") + \n  theme_tufte(base_size = 14) + \n8  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.85),\n9        legend.title.align = 0.5,\n10        legend.box.background = element_rect(colour = \"black\", fill = \"#f6f7f9\"),\n11        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f6f7f9\", color = \"#f6f7f9\"))\n\n\n\n1\n\nIn order to visualize the entire trajectory, we need to have a variable that indicates when a song was charting in the top 3\n\n2\n\nThis allows us to filter by each song whether any of the weeks charted in the top 3 for the month we’re interested in.

There are three airports servicing NYC: JFK, LGA (“LaGuardia”), and EWR (“Newark”).\n\n\nExercises\n\nChoose an airport outside New York, and count how many flights went to that airport from NYC in 2013. How many of those flights started at JFK, LGA, and EWR respectively?\nThe variable arr_delay contains arrival delays in minutes (negative values represent early arrivals). Make a ggplot histogram displaying arrival delays for 2013 flights from NYC to the airport you chose.\n\n\nUse left_join to add weather data at departure to the subsetted data. If time_hour didn’t exist in one or both of these datasets, which variables would you need to merge on? Calculate the mean temperature by month at departure (temp) across all flights.\n\n\nInvestigate if there is a relationship between departure delay (dep_delay) and precipitation (precip) in the full dataset. Is the relationship different between JFK, LGA, and EWR? I suggest answering this question by making a plot and writing down a one-sentence interpretation2.\n\n2 Hint: Read about geom_smooth() and consider how you might use it with the argument method = \"lm\" to plot a relationship between these two variables.As always, submit both the .qmd and knitted .html to Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you submit:\n\n\n\nHave you remembered to add embed-resources: true to your YAML?\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nHomework Due\nPeer Review Due\n\n\n\n\n1\n7 October\n12 October\n\n\n2\n14 October\n19 October\n\n\n3\n21 October\n26 October\n\n\n4\n28 October\n2 November\n\n\n5\n11 November\n16 November\n\n\n6\n18 November\n23 November\n\n\n7\n25 November\n30 November\n\n\n8\n2 December\n7 December\n\n\n9\n9 December\n14 December",
