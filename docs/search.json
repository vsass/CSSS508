Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at and follow all instructions. Use sections for organization, label figures/tables, and use code chunks.\n\n\nRubric Students Use to Grade Assignments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Evaluation\n      Points\n    \n  \n  \n    Didn't turn anything in.\n0\n    Turned in but low effort, ignoring many directions.\n1\n    Decent effort, followed directions with some minor issues.\n2\n    Nailed it!\n3\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer Review:\nYou are required to both grade and provide feedback on a peer’s homework each week. Reading/evaluating the work of others is useful and important! Good programmers realize that most problems have been solved by others; the trick is figuring out how to apply existing code to new problems. You will develop this skill by reading others’ code, evaluating their approach to problems, providing suggestions, and pointing out when you learned something new. Good peer reviews give constructive, polite, and insightful comments, are specific and concise, use the grading rubric below, and point out what you learned from their code. Poor peer reviews are impolite or unprofessional, are generic (i.e., could be applied to anyone’s homework), or fail to provide useful suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Homework Will Not Be Accepted For Credit\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of our schedule, peer reviews are randomly assigned when the due date/time is reached. Therefore, if you don’t submit your homework on time, you will not be given a peer’s homework to review and vice versa. Life is messy and complicated though and we all miss deadlines for a variety of reasons. Therefore, you can request that I provide you with feedback on a late assignment (message me on Slack) but you won’t be able to earn any points for that particular homework.\n\n\n\n\nRubric Instructor Uses to Grade Peer Review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Evaluation\n      Points\n    \n  \n  \n    Didn’t follow all peer-review instructions.\n\n0\n\n    Peer review is at least one paragraph long, \nmentions any and all key issues from the assignment, \nand points out at least one positive thing in your \npeer’s work (and hopefully more!).\n\n1\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Contact the Instructor:\nA number of situations may warrant contacting the instructor:\n\nIf you believe you have received an unfair peer review, you can resubmit your homework for evaluation by the instructor. The assignment will be regraded, which may result in a higher, same, or lower grade.\nIf you wish for more feedback on a particular part of the homework, you can ask the instructor for additional explanation without resubmitting during office hours or over Slack.\nIf you receive no feedback, I will provide gentle peer review on request."

    "text": "This syllabus is subject to change. All changes will be announced both in class and on this page.\n\nCourse Info:\nInstructor: Victoria Sass\nLecture: Tuesday 4:30-5:20pm (Gowen 201)\n• Lab AA Tuesday 5:30-6:20pm (Savery 117)\n• Lab AB Thursday 4:30-5:20pm (Savery 117)\nOffice Hours: Wednesdays 3-5pm (Zoom - link on Canvas)\n\n\nOverview and Learning Objectives:\nThis course is intended to give students a foundational understanding of programming in the statistical language R. This knowledge is intended to be broadly useful wherever you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:\n\nDeveloping intermediate data management and visualization skills in R\nOrganizing projects and creating reproducible research\nCleaning data\nLinking multiple data sets together\nLearning basic programming skills\n\nBy the end of this course you should feel confident approaching any data you encounter in the future. We will cover almost no statistics, however it is the intention that this course will leave you prepared to progress in CS&SS or STAT courses with the ability to focus on statistics instead of coding. Additionally, the basic concepts you learn will be applicable to other programming languages and research in general, such as logic and algorithmic thinking.\n\n\nStructure:\nThis course has a primary lecture session, a lab session, and office hours:\n\nLecture (in-person; 50 minutes): On Tuesdays, I will lead a lecture session covering a specific topic to help you learn fundamental skills, concepts, and principles for learning R. The content from lecture each week will be the basis of the homework assignment due the following week.\nLab (in-person; 50 minutes): On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we will meet in the CSSCR lab for a more interactive session where we will practice the skills from lecture. Towards the end of these sections students will work with each other to learn and practice key skills in R, but I will be available to help as well!\nOffice Hours (remote; One 2-hour session): On Wednesdays, I will hold drop-in office hours on Zoom. This is a great time to ask questions, get advice, or continue discussions from lab/lecture. We can talk in a breakout room or with the group! A link to the Zoom meeting can be found on Canvas.\n\n\n\nSchedule:\nBelow is a summary of topics that will be covered each week in lecture. Labs will focus on material covered in that week’s lecture.\n\nWeek 1: Introduction to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown\nWeek 2: Visualizing Data\nWeek 3: Workflow and Reproducibility\nWeek 4: Importing, Exporting, and Cleaning Data\nWeek 5: Manipulating and Summarizing Data\nWeek 6: Data Structures & Types\nWeek 7: Working with Text Data\nWeek 8: Writing Functions\nWeek 9: Iteration\nWeek 10: Next Steps\n\nThis course will have no meeting during final exam week.\n\n\nPrerequisites:\nThis course has no prerequisites.\n\n\nMaterials and Texts:\nThis course has no required materials or texts. However, there are a few things to note:\n\nLaptops: This course is primarily focused on computation. As a result, it is helpful to bring a personal laptop to class each day. Alternatively, you can use one of the computers available in the classroom (Savery 117, aka the “CSSCR Big Lab”). If you’d like a laptop but do not have one, you can borrow one for free from UW through the Student Technology Loan Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep In Mind\n\n\n\nThe versions of R, RStudio, and Quarto (as well as any packages you have installed) will change if you start using a different computer. My advice is to consistently use the same device or make sure to download the latest versions of R, RStudio, and Quarto when using a new machine.\n\n\n\nOnline Textbooks: This course has no required textbooks, but there are many helpful resources available for free online. I will be suggesting selections from R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, & Garrett Grolemund to pair with each week’s topic. While not required, I strongly suggest reading those selections before doing the homework for that week.\n\n\n\nTools for Class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Communication\n\n\n\nLearning is collaborative! In addition to being the place to communicate with me, our Slack Workplace is also where you can ask one another questions, share resources, and just generally check in with each other about how your adventures with R are going. You can find the link to join our workplace on our course Canvas page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Homework & Peer-Reviews\n\n\n\nWe will be using Canvas solely for homework & peer review submissions/deadlines and for any links I only want to distribute to those registered for this class (i.e. Slack and Office Hours Zoom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Course Content\n\n\n\nAll course content will be accessible on this website.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nThis course is graded as credit/no credit. To pass you need to receive at least 60% of the available points. There will be 9 graded homework assignments: one every week but the last one. There are 4 points possible for each week that features a homework.\n\nHomework (75%; 3 points): These must be turned in as rendered Markdown documents which we will learn to create and for which templates are provided. They will be graded on a 0 to 3 point scale based on a simple effort-focused rubric found on the course website. These are designed first and foremost to develop skills rather than \"prove\" you have learned concepts. I encourage you to communicate and work together, so long as you write and explain your code yourself and do not copy work. You can learn a lot from replicating others' code, but you will learn nothing if you copy it without knowing how it works! In other words, you’re not really going to learn unless you do the coding yourself!\nPeer Review (25%; 1 point): Each week an assignment is due, students will be randomly assigned to grade another student's assignment following a 0 to 3 rubric. They will be expected to provide constructive feedback and commentary if something new was learned. Reading others' code is an important skill and you will write better code knowing others will see it. These reviews will be due 5 days after homework is due. Each peer review is worth 1 point and will be evaluated by the instructor on a binary \"satisfactory\" / \"not satisfactory\" scale.\nSchedule: We have a bit of a funky schedule due to increasing demand for this course over the years. Thus, instead of a 2-hour interactive lecture/lab each week we have a 50 minute lecture and 2 separate lab sections. To make sure everyone gets to practice the skills we learn in lecture before starting their homework, the due dates for your homework and peer reviews will depend upon which lab section you’re enrolled in. Make sure to check Canvas!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Homework Will Not Be Accepted For Credit\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of our schedule, peer reviews are randomly assigned when the due date/time is reached. Therefore, if you don’t submit your homework on time, you will not be given a peer’s homework to review and vice versa. Life is messy and complicated though and we all miss deadlines for a variety of reasons. Therefore, you can request that I provide you with feedback on a late assignment (message me on Slack) but you won’t be able to earn any points for that particular homework.\n\n\n\n\nClassroom Environment\nI’m committed to fostering a friendly and inclusive classroom environment in which all students have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed. This course is an attempt to make an often difficult and frustrating experience (learning R for the first time) less obfuscating, daunting, and stressful. That said, learning happens in different ways at at a different pace for everyone. Learning is also a collaborative and creative process and my aim is to create an environment in which you all feel comfortable asking questions of me and each other. Treat your peers and yourself with empathy and respect as you all approach this topic from a range of backgrounds and experiences (in programming and in life).\n\nNames & Pronouns: Everyone deserves to be addressed respectfully and correctly. You are welcome to send me your preferred name and correct gender pronouns at any time.\nCovid Considerations: I will follow all University rules and procedures regarding Covid, which may or may not change during the quarter. I also recognize that Covid creates unique circumstances and concerns for each of us, which may limit your ability to fully attend or participate in this course. You never need to apologize to me for anything pandemic-related. If there is something I can do to make you feel more comfortable during class, please let me know!\nGetting Help: If at any point during the quarter you find yourself struggling to keep up, please let me know! I am here to help. A great place to start this process is by chatting after class, coming to office hours, or sending me a message on Slack.\nDiversity: Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of university education. Therefore, I expect you to follow the UW Student Conduct Code in your interactions with your colleagues and me in this course by respecting the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and presentation, body size/shape, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.\nAccessibility & Accommodations: Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924, uwdrs@uw.edu, or through their website. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, me (your instructor), and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.\nAcademic Integrity: Academic integrity is essential to this course and to your learning. In this course, violations of the academic integrity policy include but are not limited to: copying from a peer, copying from an online resource, or using resources from a previous iteration of the course. That said, I hope you will collaborate with peers on assignments, and use Internet resources when questions arise to help solve issues. The key is that you ultimately submit your own work. Anything found in violation of this policy will be automatically given a score of 0 with no exceptions. If the situation merits, it will also be reported to the UW Student Conduct Office, at which point it is out of my hands. If you have any questions about this policy, please do not hesitate to reach out and ask.\nReligious Accommodations: Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\nIf you have feedback on any part of this course or the classroom environment I want to hear it! You can message me directly on Slack or send me an anonymous message here. Additionally, I will send out a mid-quarter feedback survey on Slack around Week 5."

This knowledge is intended to be broadly useful wherever you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:\n\n\nDeveloping intermediate data management and visualization skills\nOrganizing projects and creating reproducible research\nCleaning data\nLinking multiple data sets together\nLearning basic programming skills\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course you should feel confident approaching any data you encounter in the future. We will cover almost no statistics, however it is the intention that this course will leave you prepared to progress in CS&SS or STAT courses with the ability to focus on statistics instead of coding. Additionally, the basic concepts you learn will be applicable to other programming languages and research in general, such as logic and algorithmic thinking."

You must use in-line R calculations/references at least once (e.g. functions like nrow(), mean(), sd(), cor(), median(), min()) and may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text.\n\n\n\nYour document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. Use chunk options echo and output to limit the code/output you show in the .html. Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text—not as printed code and output—and rounded so as not to be absurdly precise (e.g. round x with round(x, 2)).\n\n\n\nTake a look at the template provided on our course website for an idea of what this might look like using a different dataset."

Consider histograms (geom_histogram()), scatterplots (geom_point()), or lineplots (geom_line()).\nBe sure all titles, axes, and legends are clearly labelled (no raw variable names).\nInclude at least one plot with facet_wrap() or facet_grid().\nYou can use other geoms like histograms, bar charts, adding meaningful vertical or horizontal lines, etc. You may find this data visualization cheat sheet helpful.\n\nYour document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization.

There are three airports servicing NYC: JFK, LGA (“LaGuardia”), and EWR (“Newark”).\n\nChoose an airport outside New York, and count how many flights went to that airport from NYC in 2013. How many of those flights started at JFK, LGA, and EWR? (Hint: Use filter, group_by, and summarize)\nThe variable arr_delay contains arrival delays in minutes (negative values represent early arrivals). Make a ggplot histogram displaying arrival delays for 2013 flights from NYC to the airport you chose.\nUse left_join to add weather data at departure to the subsetted data1. Calculate the mean temperature by month at departure (temp) across all flights2.\nInvestigate if there is a relationship between departure delay (dep_delay) and wind speed (wind_speed). Is the relationship different between JFK, LGA, and EWR? I suggest answering this question by making a plot and writing down a one-sentence interpretation.\n\nAs always, submit both the .qmd and knitted .html to Canvas.\n\nHint 1: Match on origin, year, month, day, and hour!!Hint 2: Use mean(temp, na.rm=T) to have R calculate an average after ignoring missing data values"

There are three airports servicing NYC: JFK, LGA (“LaGuardia”), and EWR (“Newark”).\n\nChoose an airport outside New York, and count how many flights went to that airport from NYC in 2013. How many of those flights started at JFK, LGA, and EWR? (Hint: Use filter, group_by, and summarize)\nThe variable arr_delay contains arrival delays in minutes (negative values represent early arrivals). Make a ggplot histogram displaying arrival delays for 2013 flights from NYC to the airport you chose.\nUse left_join to add weather data at departure to the subsetted data1. Calculate the mean temperature by month at departure (temp) across all flights2.\nInvestigate if there is a relationship between departure delay (dep_delay) and wind speed (wind_speed). Is the relationship different between JFK, LGA, and EWR? I suggest answering this question by making a plot and writing down a one-sentence interpretation.\n\nAs always, submit both the .qmd and knitted .html to Canvas.\n\nHint 1: Match on origin, year, month, day, and hour!!Hint 2: Use mean(temp, na.rm=T) to have R calculate an average after ignoring missing data values"

There are three airports servicing NYC: JFK, LGA (“LaGuardia”), and EWR (“Newark”).\n\nChoose an airport outside New York, and count how many flights went to that airport from NYC in 2013. How many of those flights started at JFK, LGA, and EWR? (Hint: Use filter, group_by, and summarize)\nThe variable arr_delay contains arrival delays in minutes (negative values represent early arrivals). Make a ggplot histogram displaying arrival delays for 2013 flights from NYC to the airport you chose.\nUse left_join to add weather data at departure to the subsetted data1. Calculate the mean temperature by month at departure (temp) across all flights2.\nInvestigate if there is a relationship between departure delay (dep_delay) and wind speed (wind_speed). Is the relationship different between JFK, LGA, and EWR? I suggest answering this question by making a plot and writing down a one-sentence interpretation.\n\nAs always, submit both the .qmd and knitted .html to Canvas.\n\nHint 1: Match on origin, year, month, day, and hour!!Hint 2: Use mean(temp, na.rm=T) to have R calculate an average after ignoring missing data values"

Use chunk options echo and output to limit the code/output you show in the .html.

Thus, instead of a 2-hour interactive lecture/lab each week we have a 50 minute lecture and 2 separate lab sections. To make sure everyone gets to practice the skills we learn in lecture before starting their homework, the due dates for your homework and peer reviews will depend upon which lab section you’re enrolled in. Make sure to check Canvas!\n\n\n\n Late Homework Will Not Be Accepted For Credit\n\n\nDue to the nature of our schedule, peer reviews are randomly assigned when the due date/time is reached. Therefore, if you don’t submit your homework on time, you will not be given a peer’s homework to review and vice versa. Life is messy and complicated though and we all miss deadlines for a variety of reasons. Therefore, you can request that I provide you with feedback on a late assignment (message me on Slack) but you won’t be able to earn any points for that particular homework."

This is called nesting functions and is very common. I’ll introduce a method next week to avoid confusion from nesting too many functions inside each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What’s as.data.frame.matrix() Doing?\n\n\ngt() takes as its first argument a data.frame-type object, while summary() produces a table-type object.

You will be shown a preview (if available) within the presentation first and from there you can open the link in a new tab to explore it more.\n\nRelatedly, any R function in code-looking font will be linked to it’s documentation (which is the same as its help page within RStudio) so you can quickly learn more about any function we cover in class directly through the lecture slides. (Note: not all of these work in the preview so you may have to open a new tab).\n\n\nIf you hover over any chunk of R code embedded in the slides you will see a  which you can click to copy the code. You can then paste it in your own Quarto document or R script to run it in your session of RStudio.\nTo get a PDF version of these slides click File &gt; Print from your internet browser, select Save as PDF as the Destination or Printer, and make sure the Layout is set to Landscape. (Note: the PDF Export Mode in Tools actually cuts off content which is why I’m not recommending it)\nClicking on the  in the bottom left-hand corner allows you to draw directly on the slides, in a very Microsoft Paint kind of way.

All homework will be turned in on Canvas by 4:30pm the day it is due.\nSchedule\nWe have a bit of a funky schedule due to increasing demand for this course over the years. Thus, instead of a 2-hour interactive lecture/lab each week we have a 50 minute lecture and 2 separate lab sections. To make sure everyone gets to practice the skills we learn in lecture before starting their homework, the due dates for your homework and peer reviews will depend upon which lab section you’re enrolled in. Make sure to check Canvas!\n\n\n\n Late Homework Will Not Be Accepted For Credit\n\n\nDue to the nature of our schedule, peer reviews are randomly assigned when the due date/time is reached. Therefore, if you don’t submit your homework on time, you will not be given a peer’s homework to review and vice versa. Life is messy and complicated though and we all miss deadlines for a variety of reasons. Therefore, you can request that I provide you with feedback on a late assignment (message me on Slack) but you won’t be able to earn any points for that particular homework."

    "text": "I’m interested in exploring a dataset from base R called iris. From its documentation I see that it is data about 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris and their respective measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.\nI first want to take a look at a preview of the dataset by making a nice table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      Sepal.Length\n      Sepal.Width\n      Petal.Length\n      Petal.Width\n      Species\n    \n  \n  \n    1\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n    2\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n    3\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n    4\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n    5\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n    6..145\n\n\n\n\n\n    146\n6.7\n3.0\n5.2\n2.3\nvirginica\n    147\n6.3\n2.5\n5.0\n1.9\nvirginica\n    148\n6.5\n3.0\n5.2\n2.0\nvirginica\n    149\n6.2\n3.4\n5.4\n2.3\nvirginica\n    150\n5.9\n3.0\n5.1\n1.8\nvirginica\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe mean petal length is 3.758 but its median petal length is 4.35. It’s range is 5.9 which additionally suggests a certain degree of spread.\nIt might be useful to look at the distribution to gain a better sense of the variation of this variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a cluster of much smaller petals and then another cluster of average to bigger petals. I wonder how this varies by species…?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from this plot that the overall mean and median of petal length is quite misleading! Only the verisicolor species of iris is close to those values while setosa is much mush smaller and virginica is a bit bigger.\nIs there a similar thing happening for sepal length and width? Let’s look at some basic descriptives of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n       Sepal.Length\n       Sepal.Width\n       Petal.Length\n       Petal.Width\n            Species\n    \n  \n  \n    Min.   :4.300  \nMin.   :2.000  \nMin.   :1.000  \nMin.   :0.100  \nsetosa    :50  \n    1st Qu.:5.100  \n1st Qu.:2.800  \n1st Qu.:1.600  \n1st Qu.:0.300  \nversicolor:50  \n    Median :5.800  \nMedian :3.000  \nMedian :4.350  \nMedian :1.300  \nvirginica :50  \n    Mean   :5.843  \nMean   :3.057  \nMean   :3.758  \nMean   :1.199  \nNA\n    3rd Qu.:6.400  \n3rd Qu.:3.300  \n3rd Qu.:5.100  \n3rd Qu.:1.800  \nNA\n    Max.   :7.900  \nMax.   :4.400  \nMax.   :6.900  \nMax.   :2.500  \nNA\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to note with the summary function that for numerical data it’ll calculate the classic 5 statistics used to construct a boxplot plus the mean but for a categorical variable like iris$Species it returns the frequency of each value of the variable.\nThe distribution of sepal length looks wider than sepal width, similar to how it was for those measurements of the petals. Let’s see how sepal length and width relate to one another graphically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are still clusters by each species type but for verisicolor and virginica there’s much more overlap. Overall, there’s tighter clustering by species for the petal length and width than there is for the sepal length and width."

    "text": "A Note on How to Use These Slides \n\nSince the lectures for this class were created using Quarto, there are numerous built-in features meant to facilitate your learning, particularly of R.\n\n\nThe  in the bottom left-hand corner will show you a table of contents for the entire slideshow, allowing you to find what you’re looking for more easily.\nAnything followed by  is a link to an external site. You will be shown a preview (if available) within the presentation first and from there you can open the link in a new tab to explore it more.\n\nRelatedly, any R function in code-looking font will be linked to it’s documentation (which is the same as its help page within RStudio) so you can quickly learn more about any function we cover in class directly through the lecture slides. (Note: not all of these work in the preview so you may have to open a new tab).\n\n\nIf you hover over any chunk of R code embedded in the slides you will see a  which you can click to copy the code. You can then paste it in your own Quarto document or R script to run it in your session of RStudio.\nTo get a PDF version of these slides click File &gt; Print from your internet browser, select Save as PDF as the Destination or Printer, and make sure the Layout is set to Landscape. (Note: the PDF Export Mode in Tools actually cuts off content which is why I’m not recommending it)\nClicking on the  in the bottom left-hand corner allows you to draw directly on the slides, in a very Microsoft Paint kind of way. See if it’s useful but I make no promises!\nType ? at any time to see all the available key-board shortcuts.\nSome content may be scrollable (like this page!). If this is the case I will put the  icon in the title to let you know."
